    <p> Hi, my name is Oscar Chen and I am a computer science student at McGill University in Montreal. 
    <br> As a native of the city, I have been fortunate to be surrounded by a diverse and multilingual community, 
    <br> which has allowed me to become fluent in French, English, Spanish, Cantonese, and Mandarin, and have a basic understanding of Korean. </p> 
    <br> In addition to my passion for language, I have always been fascinated by the endless possibilities of computer science and am excited to be studying this field at the university level. 
    <br> I am eager to combine my linguistic skills and technical knowledge in my future career and make a positive impact through technology.
