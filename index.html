    <p> Hi, my name is Oscar Chen and I am a computer science student at McGill University in Montreal. 
    <br> As a native of the city, I have been fortunate to be surrounded by a diverse and multilingual community, which has allowed me to become fluent in French, English, Spanish, Cantonese, and Mandarin, and have a basic understanding of Korean. </p> 
    <br> In addition to my passion for language, I have always been fascinated by the endless possibilities of computer science and am excited to be studying this field at the university level. 
    <br> I am eager to combine my linguistic skills and technical knowledge in my future career and make a positive impact through technology.

    <p> During my time at Brebeuf, I was involved in extracurricular activities including chess club and IB program activities. <br>
        These experiences helped to cultivate my passion for learning and gave me valuable skills in leadership, communication, and teamwork. </p>
